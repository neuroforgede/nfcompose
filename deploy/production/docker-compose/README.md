# Docker Compose + NF Compose

This docker-compose.yml is a sample setup that can be used in a near production grade deployment
using Docker Compose.

This setup is preferred over the setup in [local](../../local/) for
development as deploy/local is more so intended for integration testing in CI pipelines.
