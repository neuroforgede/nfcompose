Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br><br>   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br><br>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br><br>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br>      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;{}&quot;<br>      replaced with your own identifying information.

No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the<br>distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.<br>Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a<br>Contributor:<br><br>(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;<br>    or<br><br>(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party&#x27;s<br>    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its<br>    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor<br>    Version); or<br><br>(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of<br>    its Contributions.<br><br>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,<br>or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with<br>the notice requirements in Section 3.4).<br><br>2.4. Subsequent Licenses<br><br>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to<br>distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this<br>License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if<br>permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).<br><br>2.5. Representation<br><br>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its<br>Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights<br>to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.<br><br>2.6. Fair Use<br><br>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under<br>applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other<br>equivalents.<br><br>2.7. Conditions<br><br>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted<br>in Section 2.1.<br><br>3. Responsibilities<br>-------------------<br><br>3.1. Distribution of Source Form<br><br>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any<br>Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under<br>the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source<br>Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this<br>License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not<br>attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&#x27; rights in the Source Code<br>Form.<br><br>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<br><br>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<br><br>(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code<br>    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of<br>    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code<br>    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more<br>    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<br><br>(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this<br>    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the<br>    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter<br>    the recipients&#x27; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.<br><br>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<br><br>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,<br>provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for<br>the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered<br>Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the<br>Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this<br>License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software<br>under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of<br>the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered<br>Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary<br>License(s).<br><br>3.4. Notices<br><br>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices<br>(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,<br>or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of<br>the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to<br>the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<br><br>3.5. Application of Additional Terms<br><br>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,<br>indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered<br>Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br>behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any<br>such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by<br>You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any<br>liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,<br>indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional<br>disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any<br>jurisdiction.<br><br>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<br>---------------------------------------------------<br><br>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br>License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to<br>statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br>the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br>describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must<br>be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered<br>Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute<br>or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a<br>recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br><br>5. Termination<br>--------------<br><br>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically<br>if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become<br>compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular<br>Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such<br>Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an<br>ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the<br>non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have<br>come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular<br>Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor<br>notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the<br>first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License<br>from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after<br>Your receipt of the notice.<br><br>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent<br>infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,<br>counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version<br>directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to<br>You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section<br>2.1 of this License shall terminate.<br><br>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all<br>end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which<br>have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License<br>prior to termination shall survive termination.<br><br>************************************************************************<br>*                                                                      *<br>*  6.

Litigation<br>-------------<br><br>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the<br>courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal<br>place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that<br>jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.<br>Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party&#x27;s ability to bring<br>cross-claims or counter-claims.<br><br>9. Miscellaneous<br>----------------<br><br>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject<br>matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br>unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br>necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides<br>that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter<br>shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.<br><br>10. Versions of the License<br>---------------------------<br><br>10.1. New Versions<br><br>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section<br>10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or<br>publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a<br>distinguishing version number.<br><br>10.2. Effect of New Versions<br><br>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version<br>of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,<br>or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license<br>steward.<br><br>10.3. Modified Versions<br><br>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to<br>create a new license for such software, you may create and use a<br>modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove<br>any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that<br>such modified license differs from this License).<br><br>10.4.

By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>Foundation&#x27;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br>your programs, too.<br><br>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br><br>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br><br>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>rights.<br><br>  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>distribute and/or modify the software.<br><br>  Also, for each author&#x27;s protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>authors&#x27; reputations.<br><br>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>patent must be licensed for everyone&#x27;s free use or not licensed at all.<br><br>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow.<br><br>            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br>  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,<br>refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<br>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br><br>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br><br>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#x27;s<br>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>along with the Program.<br><br>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br>    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>    parties under the terms of this License.<br><br>    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br><br>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br><br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>collective works based on the Program.<br><br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>the scope of this License.<br><br>  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br><br>    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br>    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br><br>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br>special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>itself accompanies the executable.<br><br>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br>  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>parties remain in full compliance.<br><br>  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>the Program or works based on it.<br><br>  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>restrictions on the recipients&#x27; exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>this License.<br><br>  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br><br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>circumstances.<br><br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>impose that choice.<br><br>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br><br>  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br><br>  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>address new problems or concerns.<br><br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<br>later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>Foundation.<br><br>  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br><br>                NO WARRANTY<br><br>  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br><br>  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br><br>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br><br>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br><br>    &lt;one line to give the program&#x27;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br><br>    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>    (at your option) any later version.<br><br>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>    GNU General Public License for more details.<br><br>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br><br><br>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br><br>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>when it starts in an interactive mode:<br><br>    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author<br>    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#x27;.<br>    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>    under certain conditions; type `show c&#x27; for details.<br><br>The hypothetical commands `show w&#x27; and `show c&#x27; should show the appropriate<br>parts of the General Public License.

Here<br>    is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this<br>    package (but check the individual files to be sure!):<br><br>      - liblzma is in the public domain.<br><br>      - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public<br>        domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked<br>        in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under<br>        GNU LGPLv2.1+.<br><br>      - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been<br>        adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are<br>        under GNU GPLv2+.<br><br>      - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the<br>        XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories<br>        are in the public domain.<br><br>      - Translated messages are in the public domain.<br><br>      - The build system contains public domain files, and files that<br>        are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up<br>        in the binaries being built.<br><br>      - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging<br>        utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.<br><br>      - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files<br>        that are under various free software licenses.<br><br>    You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into<br>    the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,<br>    take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find<br>    the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many<br>    lawyers.<br><br>    As usual, this software is provided &quot;as is&quot;, without any warranty.<br><br>    If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils<br>    into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is<br>    polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but<br>    naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good<br>    notice to put into &quot;about box&quot; or into documentation:<br><br>        This software includes code from XZ Utils &lt;http://tukaani.org/xz/&gt;.<br><br>    The following license texts are included in the following files:<br>      - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1<br>      - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2<br>      - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3<br><br>    Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code<br>    pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma<br>    binary wouldn&#x27;t actually be in the public domain in its entirety<br>    even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source<br>    package.<br><br>    If you have questions, don&#x27;t hesitate to ask the author(s) for more<br>    information.<br><br><br>----<br><br>LIBPNG<br><br>COPYRIGHT NOTICE, DISCLAIMER, and LICENSE<br>=========================================<br><br>PNG Reference Library License version 2<br>---------------------------------------<br><br> * Copyright (c) 1995-2022 The PNG Reference Library Authors.<br> * Copyright (c) 2018-2022 Cosmin Truta.<br> * Copyright (c) 2000-2002, 2004, 2006-2018 Glenn Randers-Pehrson.<br> * Copyright (c) 1996-1997 Andreas Dilger.<br> * Copyright (c) 1995-1996 Guy Eric Schalnat, Group 42, Inc.<br><br>The software is supplied &quot;as is&quot;, without warranty of any kind,<br>express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties<br>of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and<br>non-infringement.

If You<br>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br><br>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>      meet the following conditions:<br><br>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br><br>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>          stating that You changed the files; and<br><br>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>          the Derivative Works; and<br><br>      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its<br>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>          as modifying the License.<br><br>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>      the conditions stated in this License.<br><br>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br><br>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br><br>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,<br>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br><br>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br><br>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br><br>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br>      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;<br>      replaced with your own identifying information.

Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br><br>  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br><br>  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br><br>  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>version:<br><br>   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br><br>   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>   this License applicable to that copy.<br><br>  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br><br>  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<br>code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br><br>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>   covered by this License.<br><br>   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>   document.<br><br>  4. Combined Works.<br><br>  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>the following:<br><br>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>   covered by this License.<br><br>   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>   document.<br><br>   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br><br>   d) Do one of the following:<br><br>       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>       Corresponding Source.<br><br>       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>       a copy of the Library already present on the user&#x27;s computer<br>       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>       Version.<br><br>   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br><br>  5. Combined Libraries.<br><br>  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>choice, if you do both of the following:<br><br>   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>   conveyed under the terms of this License.<br><br>   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br><br>  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br><br>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;<br>applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br>  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>apply, that proxy&#x27;s public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>Library.<br></td>

Combined Libraries.<br><br>  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br>facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br>License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br>choice, if you do both of the following:<br><br>   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br>   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br>   conveyed under the terms of this License.<br><br>   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br>   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br>   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br><br>  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br><br>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br>Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br>of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;<br>applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br>published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br>received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br>  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>apply, that proxy&#x27;s public statement of acceptance of any version is<br>permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br>Library.<br></td>

Additional Definitions.<br><br>  As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br>General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU<br>General Public License.<br><br>  &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br>other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br><br>  An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br>by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br>Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br>of using an interface provided by the Library.<br><br>  A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an<br>Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library<br>with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked<br>Version&quot;.<br><br>  The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the<br>Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br>for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br>based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br><br>  The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the<br>object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br>and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br>Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br><br>  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br><br>  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br>without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br><br>  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br><br>  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br>facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br>that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br>facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br>version:<br><br>   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br>   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br>   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br>   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br><br>   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br>   this License applicable to that copy.<br><br>  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br><br>  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br>a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<br>code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br>material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br>layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br>(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br><br>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br>   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>   covered by this License.<br><br>   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>   document.<br><br>  4. Combined Works.<br><br>  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br>taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br>portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br>engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br>the following:<br><br>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br>   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br>   covered by this License.<br><br>   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br>   document.<br><br>   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br>   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br>   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br>   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br><br>   d) Do one of the following:<br><br>       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br>       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br>       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br>       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br>       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br>       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br>       Corresponding Source.<br><br>       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br>       a copy of the Library already present on the user&#x27;s computer<br>       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br>       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br>       Version.<br><br>   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br>   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br>   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br>   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br>   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br>   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br>   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br>   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br>   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br>   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br>   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br><br>  5.

            <td>A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE<br>==========================<br><br>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting<br>Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands<br>as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python&#x27;s<br>principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.<br><br>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for<br>National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)<br>in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the<br>software.<br><br>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to<br>BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same<br>year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became<br>Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see<br>https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization<br>created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.<br>Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.<br><br>All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for<br>the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python<br>releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes<br>the various releases.<br><br>    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-<br>                    from                                compatible?
