    taken from inflection lib:

    https://inflection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/inflection.html#underscore
    
    Make an underscored, lowercase form from the expression in the string.

    Example::

        >>> underscore("DeviceType")
        "device_type"

    As a rule of thumb you can think of :func:`underscore` as the inverse of
    :func:`camelize`, though there are cases where that does not hold::

        >>> camelize(underscore("IOError"))
        "IoError"

    word = word.replace("-", "_")
    return word.lower()
